    "chunk": "2.1 The objective of this technical cooperation is to share knowledge products developed through the implementation of the Water Security Strategy and the Transboundary Program of INE/WSA at the COP 30 and events pre-COP. This includes promoting the recently approved program funded by GCF and IDB, “Improving Climate Resilience by Increasing Water Security in the Amazon Basin.” While this TC focuses on the Amazon basin, it will also incorporate technical expertise and lessons learned from TCs executed in other regions of LAC. The aim is to provide reference knowledge products from these regions on water resilience, that can serve as replicable case studies for the Amazon, particularly in the context of COP30 in Belém, Brazil. The specific objectives of this TC are: (1) support the development and dissemination of knowledge products and communication materials on water resilience and the implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in the water and sanitation sector, (2) facilitate technical and political dialogues related to these knowledge products in preparation for the COP30, and (3) promote the dissemination of the GCF Water Security Program in the Amazon.",

As the largest hydrographic basin in the world, it produces nearly 20% of the planet's freshwater and contains 25% of the world's terrestrial biodiversity. In South America, it represents 70% of the freshwater discharge, playing a vital role in regulating climate patterns, sustaining ecosystems, ensuring water, food and energy security, and supporting the livelihoods of local communities. Furthermore, the Amazon is crucial to climate resilience as it naturally sequesters approximately 150–200 billion tons of carbon dioxide in soils and vegetation, functioning as one of the planet’s largest carbon sinks.",
