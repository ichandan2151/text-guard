The aim is to provide reference knowledge products from these regions on water resilience, that can serve as replicable case studies for the Amazon, particularly in the context of COP30 in Belém, Brazil. The specific objectives of this TC are: (1) support the development and dissemination of knowledge products and communication materials on water resilience and the implementation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in the water and sanitation sector, (2) facilitate technical and political dialogues related to these knowledge products in preparation for the COP30, and (3) promote the dissemination of the GCF Water Security Program in the Amazon.", "labels": ["water_resources_and_watershed_management", "nature_based_solutions_and_ecosystems", "climate_resilience_and_flood_drought", "institutional_capacity_and_regulation", "behavior_change_and_community_engagement"], "risk_level": "Low", "compliance_status": "In_Progress"}
