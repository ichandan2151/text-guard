The program, structured as a GOM, aims to strengthen The Bahamas’ connectivity with the Caribbean and the wider world by improving air travel efficiency and accessibility for both residents and visitors. This will be achieved through infrastructure upgrades—including the rehabilitation and maintenance of four Family Island airports (Exuma, North Eleuthera, Marsh Harbour, and Treasure Cay)—to ensure compliance with international aviation standards, with consideration for climate resilience and sustainability.

In Mexico, 102,895.00 tons of urban waste are generated daily, of which 83.93% are collected and 78.54% are disposed of in final disposal sites, recycling only 9.63% of the waste generated. These services are legally under the jurisdiction of the municipal level; water and sanitation are usually managed by the same entity, while solid waste management has lacked attention and resources, contributing to the problem of inadequate solid waste disposal, including biosolids from wastewater treatment plants, worsening the pollution of surface and ground waters. With an increasing population and the growing effects of climate change, these challenges must be urgently addressed with insufficient time and resources; technological innovation can play a key role in providing more effective and faster solutions. Sector institutions in Mexico, such as the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), National Water Commission (CONAGUA), National Association of Water and Sanitation Entities (ANEAS), also consider the role of innovation as crucial for the operators to be able to overcome these challenges. Newly appointed President, Claudia Sheinbaum, expressed her commitment to promoting innovation; among her key projects, the development of technological solutions for the efficient use of water and energy was included as part of a new technological development plan for Mexico. This technical cooperation can, thus, help setting up financing schemes and operations, by supporting the elaboration of such studies and pre-investment projects, duly considering Japanese innovation and state-of-the art expertise. The TC will directly benefit sectoral organizations related to water, sanitation, and solid waste, and indirectly benefit households and users of these services in Mexico.
